> Cross-browser directory uploads made easy

uppie wraps all current implementations of directory uploads into one simple function call and delivers a standardized `FormData` object to be summitted through XHR. Both the `<input>` element and drag and drop are supported. The minimum required browsers are Chrome 29+, Firefox 42+ and Edge.

## Example usage
```html
<input type="file" id="file-input" multiple directory webkitdirectory/>
<script src="uppie.js"></script>
```
```js
var uppie = new Uppie();

uppie(document.querySelector("#file-input"), function (formData, files) {
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open("POST", "/upload");
  xhr.send(formData);
});
```

## API
### Uppie([options])
Valid options for the constructor are:
- `empty` *boolean*: Whether to include empty directories. To discern from empty files, empty directories are identified by a trailing slash in both the `name` and `filename` formData fields and will require special code on the server to handle. Default: `false`.

### uppie(node, callback)
- `node` *Node*: If a file input is given, uppie will monitor it for `change` events. Any other element type will be enabled as a dropzone and watched for `drop` events. If you want to use both on the same element, use a hidden `<input>` and forward the click event.
- `callback` *function*: callback which is called every time the selected files change or when files are dropped in the dropzone.

The callback receives `formData` (to be used for XHR uploading) and `files` (an array of paths, useful previewing).

## Recommended `input` attributes

- `multiple`: to allow multiple files to be selected
- `directory`: to enable directory upload in Firefox (42+) and Edge
- `webkitDirectory`: to enable directory upload in Chrome (29+)

## Notes

- Chrome's `<input>` implementation doesn't include empty directories ([Chromium bug](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?can=2&id=360412)).
- Drag and drop uploads may not work in Firefox yet because of a browser bug.
- See [here](https://microsoftedge.github.io/directory-upload/proposal.html) for more details on the API implemented in Firefox and Edge.
- Needs to be tested on Edge.
